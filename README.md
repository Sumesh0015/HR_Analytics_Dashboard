### Developed by ** Sumesh Gareri **

This repository contains an end-to-end **HR Analytics Dashboard** built in **Power BI**, designed to help organizations understand employee attrition, workforce demographics, job roles, salary distribution, and experience patterns.

The dashboard converts raw HR data into meaningful insights that support **data-driven decision making** in talent management.

## Objective

To analyze **why employees leave**, who is at higher risk of attrition, and which areas HR must focus on to improve retention, hiring strategy, and workforce planning.
